# cybersecurity-notes

This repository contains my write-ups for retired machines from Hack The Box.
I document each attack process for review and reflection, aiming to improve my cybersecurity skills.

Currently, I focus on Easy machines to understand the fundamental structure of an attack.
Once I build a solid foundation, I plan to dive deeper into CVE analysis to better understand the technical details behind each vulnerability and the underlying technologies.
